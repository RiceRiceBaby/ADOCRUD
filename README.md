# ADOCRUD
Lightweight ORM that is an extension of Dapper. Handles automatic insert, update, and removal of objects without having to write any sql statements.
Since this is an extension of Dapper, you still write sql statements to retrieve data, but that data will automatically be mapped to your
C# objects.
